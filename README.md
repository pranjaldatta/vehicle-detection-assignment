# vehicle-detection-assignment
Assignment made for Vehicle Detection in 18CSE392T

Since GitHub, has limited Colab Notebook support and often is very buggy, the full notebook can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pranjaldatta/vehicle-detection-assignment/blob/main/ml_vehicledet_notebook.ipynb) in much cleaner view!

## How to use

* Open the notebook either in GitHub or with this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pranjaldatta/vehicle-detection-assignment/blob/main/ml_vehicledet_notebook.ipynb)

* Click on the **Open in Colab** button at the top of the notebook. 

* Be sure to connect to a **gpu runtime** (CPU runtime also works but CPU vs GPU runtime/frame is 0.3 secs vs 0.03 secs on an average)

* Run all the cells!
